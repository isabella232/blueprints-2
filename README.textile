Blueprints is a "property graph model interface":http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph. It provides implementations, test suites, and supporting extensions. Graph databases and frameworks that implement the Blueprints interfaces automatically support Blueprints-enabled applications. Likewise, Blueprints-enabled applications can plug-and-play different Blueprints-enabled graph backends.

We moved OrientDB Blueprints project to be merged in OrientDB official repository:

https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/tree/master/graphdb

This repository is deprecated and will be removed in the next weeks.
